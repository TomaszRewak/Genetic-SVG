# Genetic SVG

Work in progress :)

A heuristic based on genetic algorithm designed to generate SVG images from raster ones.

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomaszRewak/Genetic-SVG/master/GeneticSVG/examples/apple.png)

To run the server execute this command (server is here just for routing of static files, algorithm executes in the user's browser):
```
node .\server\dist\server.js
```
